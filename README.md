### Introduction
My name is Yann and I am a Software Engineer. I live in Switzerland, more precisely on the edge of the canton of Bern, close to the border with the Jura.

I'm passionate about development and new technologies, I decided to use GitHub when I code in my free time to support my applications. I was a regular on Bitbucket and worked mostly on private repositories.
